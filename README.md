<p>Fighting Style: Close-range Combat and Long-range Combat</p>

<p>Personality: Is a very timid, helpful, and polite boy, frequently overreacting to abnormal situations with exaggerated expressions. Due to being bullied for lacking a Quirk, he is initially portrayed as insecure, more reserved, and non-expressive. These traits are especially present around Katsuki, who constantly ridiculed him for his aspirations to be a hero. However, after being accepted into U.A. Highscool, making new friends, and facing Katsuki during the Battle Tri Arc, Midoriya gradually turned into a more confident and brave person, eventually developing leadership skills. Has a great analytical mind and can form complex battle plans in seconds.</p>

<p>Blood Type: A</p>

<p>Reference: Class 1-A</p>

<p>Fighting Style: Melee and Ranged Combat</p>

<p>Personality: Crude, arrogant, short-tempered, and an aggressive person. Tends to disregard the notion that Quirks shouldn't be used in public, and will activate his Quirk for a number of reasons, such as to intimidate someone, to punctuate a point, out of frustration, or even if he just feels like showing off. Developed a superiority complex, and because of that, he desires to be the first and best at everything.</p>



<h1>Todoroki Shoto</h1>

<p>Fighting Style: Ranged Combat</p>

<p>Personality: Originally had a cold, aloof personality which stemmed from his abusive upbringing. Focused and unemotional, Shoto preferred to keep to himself instead of hanging out with other people. After the events of the U.A. Sports Festival, however, Shoto has become noticeably more sociable, even gaining a sense of humor and occasionally smiling, although still retaining the remnants of a distant attitude. After the events in the Remedial Course Arc, he has begun to open up more to his classmates and has lightened up from his usually serious demeanor. Is quite seasoned in battle, being able to stay calm and composed even while fighting real villains. Though brutal in combat, Shoto is well-grounded on the ethics of heroism, only wishing to subdue his frozen opponents as opposed to killing them by prolonging their frozen states.</p>

Momo can be blunt with her comments about people's mistakes and miscalculations, tending to be very honest and wishing to help her peers improve enough to become great heroes, like tutoring them on her home. Momo shows further development as a selfless hero who gets inspiration from others, realizing the important thing is to focus on saving her and help them out at that moment even if it means losing her provisional hero license.

<h1>Fumikage Tokoyami</h1>

<p>Quirk: Dark Shadow</p>

<p>Height: 5'2¼"</p>

<p>Blood Type: AB</p>

<p>Reference: Class 1-A</p>

<p>Fighting Style: Melee Combat</p>

<p>Personality: Is reserved, serious, and focused, albeit noble and valiant as well. Though he does not talk very much, he will directly ignore questions or requests that seem in some way pointless while he talks to other people as some sort of ongoing joke. When Fumikage teams up with others, he becomes more sociable, helping his teammates out, reassuring his trust in them and thanking them for their effort. Fumikage is fond of darkness and other related concepts, considering himself a "creature of the dark" and employing archaic-sounding speeches that end up painting him as slightly dramatic. Still, Fumikage is a bit insecure about his interests due to them being more on the arcane, fantastical side, and thus harder for others to understand or relate to. He also possesses a great amount of humility, being aware of his own limits. He takes any advice he gets seriously and uses it to try and improve on his Quirk and abilities. Fumikage seems to hold a certain level of belief in the concept of fate, and thinks little about fame and idolatry, but is still prideful enough to not tolerate being looked down.</p>


<h1>Hanta Sero</h1>
<img src="https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/bokunoheroacademia/images/6/6c/Hanta_Sero_Full_Body_Uniform.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/202?cb=20161230191259">

<p>Hero Name: Taping Hero: Cellophane</p>

<p>Age: 16</p>

<p>Birthday: 07/28</p>

<p>Quirk: Tape</p>

<p>Height: 5' 9¾"</p>

<p>Blood Type: B</p>

<p>Reference: Class 1-A</p>

<p>Fighting Style: Ranged and Support Combat</p>

<p>Personality: Is a very friendly person and has proven to be one of the more sociable members of Class 1-A. He can be loud and showy at times, often trying to impress his peers with his Quirk. He is often the only person to call his classmates out when they are acting crazy. He is quite humorous and often takes part in making jokes with his classmates. However, when push comes to shove, Hanta is a brave hero in training who wishes to prosper on his own while helping others do the same. He easily makes friends with those around him and is shown to be a very laid-back guy.</p>


<h1>Minoru Mineta</h1>
<img src="https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/bokunoheroacademia/images/6/66/Minoru_Mineta_Full_Body_School_Uniform_Anime.png/revision/latest?cb=20160118115800">

<p>Quirk: Pop Off </p>

<p>Blood Type: N/A</p>

<p>Reference: Class 1-A</p>

<p>Fighting Style: N/A</p>

<p>Personality: is perverted to the point of infamy, which makes him unpopular with the girls and even some of the boys, who consider his interests and mannerisms depraved. His mind frequently trails off to lewd thoughts, even in situations involving completely unrelated matters. When an opportunity to peep at the girls arises, Minoru becomes very determined to take it, although this often leads to painful results. Minoru's interest in women is one of his motivations to become a hero, alongside general popularity. He is quite unashamed of those traits, openly admitting them out loud. Minoru can be very hypocritical, criticizing others for perceived perverted behavior, even if they turn out to be nothing more than misunderstandings. Minoru is also one who always speaks his mind, even when it comes off as harsh and insulting due to his comments being more on the cynical side. Minoru easily freaks out in moments of great stress or fear, acting in an impulsive way, crying when the situation does not look favorable and abusing his Quirk recklessly, to the point of hurting himself in the process. Minoru is not a very confident fighter and may attempt to flee in highly disadvantageous situations.</p>


<h1>Kyoka Jiro </h1>        
<img src="https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/bokunoheroacademia/images/8/8c/Kyoka_Jiro_Full_Body_Uniform.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/132?cb=20161230185934">

<p>Age: 16</p>

<p>Height: 5'1"</p>

<p>Blood Type: A</p>

<p>Reference: Class 1-A</p>

<p>Fighting Style: Medium Range Support</p>

<p>Personality: Kyoka has a pragmatic, unenthusiastic and teasing personality that is mostly shown to those she finds irritating, like her fellow classmate Denki Kaminari, whose cluelessness makes him an easy target for her snarky comments. Kyoka is not always like this though, as she does enjoy socializing with others, in which case she is usually nice and friendly. Kyoka often gesticulates through her elongated earlobes in place of her hands. She can also be quite aggressive, evidenced when she uses the Earphone Jacks her Quirk provides to physically punish people when provoked, or to keep them in line, most notably Denki and Minoru Mineta. During hero activities, however, Kyoka prefers smarter approaches, usually by coming up with a plan herself. She is surprisingly organized and makes sure to convey her ideas in a way that's easy to understand.</p>


<h1>Mezo Shoji</h1>
<img src="https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/bokunoheroacademia/images/5/55/Mezo_Shoji_Full_Body_Uniform.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/247?cb=20161230190626">

<p>Reference: Class 1-A</p>

<p>Fighting Style: N/A</p>

<p>Personality: Despite his frightening appearance, Mezo is a very friendly and gentle person who will work nicely with anyone. He is not the type to hold grudges, showing no ill will towards those that harm him unwillingly. Mezo is quite selfless and willing to risk his life for a friend. He can be empathetic and understanding, but still shows a sense of maturity and responsibility that prevents himself from acting under emotional impulses, even if he feels regretful about it. It is evident that he is very protective of his fellow classmates, especially if they are hurt or injured.</p>


<p>Rikido Sato</p>
<img src="https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/bokunoheroacademia/images/c/c9/Rikido_Sato_Full_Body_Uniform.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/163?cb=20161230192002">

<p>Height: 6'1"</p>

<p>Blood Type: O</p>

<p>Reference: Class 1-A</p>

<p>Fighting Style: Close Combat</p>

<p>Personality: Rikido has an interest in sweets and baking, the latter being a useful skill to have due to his Quirk. He is surprisingly talented at making sweets, conquering his classmates with his food. The fact that Rikido was caught off guard by this overly positive reaction suggests that he himself doesn't think much of his own abilities.</p>


<h1>Koji Koda</h1>
<img src="https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/bokunoheroacademia/images/2/20/Koji_Koda_Full_Body_Uniform.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/210?cb=20161230192420">

<p>Height: 6' 1¼"</p>

<p>Blood Type: A</p>

<p>Reference: Class 1-A</p>

<p>Fighting Style: N/A</p>

<p>Personality: Contrary to his powerful and brutish appearance, Koji is a very shy and quiet person. As such, he rarely speaks and prefers using sign language to communicate with his classmates, so much so that Kyoka Jiro assumed that he was mute. According to Fumikage Tokoyami, he is very good at keeping secrets. He also hates violence due to his kind-hearted nature. He appears to enjoy the company of animals, even owning a small rabbit as a pet. With his Quirk, Koji can interact with them in ways others can't. He also owns a few animal dolls and decorations in his room, implying that he likes cute things. Koji suffers from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/entomophobia "wikipedia:entomophobia">entomophobia</a>, being deathly afraid of bugs, with the mere sight of them making him scream and run away in fear. However, Koji is capable of putting this fear aside if it means helping his comrades.</p>


<h1>Eijiro Kirishima</h1>

<p>Hero Name: Sturdy Hero: Red Riot</p>

<p>Age: 16</p>

<p>Birthday: 10/16</p>

<p>Quirk: Hardening </p>

<p>Height: 5'7"</p>

<p>Blood Type: O </p>

<p>Reference: Class 1-A</p>

<p>Fighting Style: Close Combat</p>

<p>Personality: Eijiro is a boisterous and outgoing guy with a fondness for the concept of manliness, often using the terms "manly" and "unmanly" to describe things and people he does or doesn't like. Those who showcase a noble, brave, and/or determined attitude tend to emotionally move him to tears, quickly earning his complete admiration, respect, and friendship. Similarly, he will call out traits that are the opposite of that, such as cowardice and dirty play. He is also a big fan of <a href="https://bokunoheroacademia.fandom.com/wiki/Crimson_Riot "Crimson Riot">Crimson Riot</a>, a retro hero that he takes inspiration from, including his own hero name. Eijiro is very honest and kind-hearted, with All Might praising his heroic spirit. In addition, he seems capable of making friends with most people, as he is one of the few classmates who is friends with both Katsuki Bakugo and Izuku Midoriya. Eijiro is very dedicated to his friends, especially Katsuki (who he's very loyal to), and is even willing to break laws and rules in order to help them, showing regret if he becomes unable to aid in any way. This sometimes leads to Eijiro being very hard on himself.</p>


<h1>Denki Kaminari</h1>
<img src="https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/bokunoheroacademia/images/b/bb/Denki_Kaminari.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/189?cb=20190129015706">

<p>Hero Name: Stun Gun Hero: Chargebolt</p>

<p>Age: 16</p>

<p>Quirk: Electrification </p>

<p>Height: 5'6"</p>

<p>Blood Type: O</p>

<p>Reference: Class 1-A</p>

<p>Fighting Style: Close/Medium Range Combat</p>

<p>Personality: Denki is a friendly, social and energetic boy who likes to hang out with people. He is rather casual when interacting with others, including antagonistic figures like Katsuki Bakugo. Denki may come off as blunt and reckless at times, but is always well-meaning. Denki is somewhat flirtatious towards the girls of his class (and even the ones from other classes), often accompanying Mineta Minoru on their schemes and trying to pass himself off as a smooth talker. He is not very lucky with his approaches though, frequently having his advances ignored or outright rejected by everyone he asks out. He is also slightly mischievous, joining in pranks occasionally. Overall, it appears that Denki has an interest in appearing cool, but has a shallow understanding of how to do so properly. As such, he gets easily influenced by what's popular or stylish at the moment. Denki is not very academically bright, requiring help when it comes to studying due to his constant neglect of school duties. He does not appear to show much interest in classes, gets easily bored from lectures and suffers anxiety attacks when dealing with tests. Despite this, Denki can show surprising knowledge about certain areas such as literature, art and music, possessing a large vocabulary that shows up every now and then. His overall lack of wit and tact often results in Denki looking like a fool in front of others, making him a common victim of snark, in particular from Kyoka. Denki becomes quickly distraught when put into stressful situations. During combat situations, he is very quick to panic, leading him to accidentally activate his Quirk in the face of any imminent danger and leaving himself vulnerable in the process. He becomes more reluctant to use his full power when there are allies close to him, being afraid of hurting them through collateral damage from his volatile bolts.</p>


<h1>Mashirao Ojiro</h1>

<p>Birthday: 05/28</p>

<p>Quirk: Tail</p> 

<p>Height: 5'6"</p>

<p>Blood Type: O</p>

<p>Reference: Class 1-A</p>

<p>Fighting Style: Melee Combat</p>

<p>Personality: Mashirao has a very calm and noble attitude, as well as a very deep sense of dignity, which prevents him from accepting results that he doesn't feel were earned with his own abilities. He is also described as a hard worker. Along with a strong sense of dignity, Mashirao can be described as sheepish and bashful, not very often enjoying the spotlight and being easily embarrassed. He is quite humble, yet also reliable and focused during hero work. A recurring joke is that others tend to view as "plain", something that deeply upsets him, showing that he's sensitive and self-conscious about his own personality and abilities. When something excites him, he wags his tail, in a similar fashion to a dog.</p>


<p>Ochaco Uraraka</p>
<img src="https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/bokunoheroacademia/images/6/69/Ochaco_School_Uniform_Full_Body.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/195?cb=20190215054343">

<p>Hero Name: Uravity</p>

<p>Age: 16</p>

<p>Birthday: 12/27</p>

<p>Quirk: Zero Gravity</p>

<p>Height: 5' 1½"</p>

<p>Blood Type: B</p>

<p>Reference: Class 1-A</p>

<p>Fighting Style: Melee and Support Combat</p>

<p>Personality: Ochaco has been described by other students as "the most laidback girl" among her class, being very bubbly and kind of an airhead at times. She is often incredibly blunt without being aware of it. Similar to Izuku Midoriya, Ochaco's reactions tend to be exaggerated and humorous: She often becomes amused at certain personality traits and quirks others exhibit, bursting into laughter at times, which she tries to suppress. Ochaco is a very warm, lively individual who thinks about everything positively, though she is objective enough to see flaws and virtues. She is empathetic in general, friendly to those she meets, and will try to help or defend anyone who is kind to her or who needs assistance. Ochaco seems to be very good at reading people, understanding the reasons for Izuku and Katsuki Bakugo’s rivalry and being the first to notice when the usually collected Tsuyu Asui was upset. Her empathy and kindness are also seen in how well she gets along with her classmates. She is on good terms with everyone, and is particularly close friends with several members of the class, including Izuku, Tenya Iida, Tsuyu, and so on. Despite her usually cheery and sometimes ditzy demeanor, Ochaco can take on an extremely determined, focused, and somewhat intimidating attitude when the situation calls for it. This side can come as a surprise to those who are used to her bubbly nature, and it tends to appear during competitive situations like the <a href="https://bokunoheroacademia.fandom.com/wiki/U.A._Sports_Festival "U.A. Sports Festival">U.A. Sports Festival</a>. While she is shown to be surprisingly strategic, she isn't above making some impulsive or reckless decisions. When it comes to her chosen path as a Hero, Ochaco is unwavering and dislikes being underestimated, even in the face of overwhelming force.</p>

<p>Blood Type: A</p>

<p>Reference: Class 1-A</p>

<p>Fighting Style: Close Combat</p>

<p>Personality: a very straightforward, earnest, intelligent, sophisticated, disciplined, strict and noble person. He tends to take everything very seriously, and because of this, he has a habit of jumping to conclusions, then enthusiastically speaking or acting based on said conclusions. For example, after assuming that Izuku Midoriya had figured out the true nature of the U.A. Entrance Exam, Tenya acknowledged him as a worthy peer and has since held him in high esteem. All this enthusiasm leads Tenya to be hyperactive and intense, having some involuntary body tics such as moving his arms around in strange patterns and sometimes twitching his own body uncontrollably. Tenya is extremely dedicated to his studies and is always eager to learn new things. As Class 1-A's representative, Tenya is obsessed with organization and discipline, expecting his classmates to follow suit, which more often than not annoys them. At the same time, Tenya takes personal responsibility for the safety of his classmates, considering it his duty as class representative to protect and keep them away from dangerous situations. Tenya is very humble, willing to admit to his mistakes, apologize for rude behavior and improve himself in areas he is lacking. He values honor and fair play and will become angered if it turns out that he is being manipulated. He decided to leave his damaged left hand unhealed as a reminder of his recklessness and also as a motivation to pursue true heroism.</p>

<p>Blood Type: B</p>

<p<>Reference: Class 1-A</p>

<p>Fighting Style: Melee and Support Combat</p>

<p>Personality: Tsuyu is a straightforward and laid-back individual who always speaks directly from her mind and what she thinks about others. Has proven to be very observant of others, as she was the first to note the similarities between Izuku Midoriya and All Might’s Quirk. Tsuyu is noticeably calm and collected, being able to stay levelheaded in stressful situations. Smart and studious, Tsuyu is known for having great judgment and is rarely moved by emotion. Because of this, Recovery Girl describes her as a "perfect pillar of emotional support" capable of leading others. However, even Tsuyu has limits when it comes to staying composed, having broken down in despair or heartbreak a few times. Her words may also come off as unintentionally harsh thanks to her blunt honesty, resulting in her feeling guilty and regretful when she speaks out against her friends.</p>

<p>Reference: Class 1-A</p>

<p>Fighting Style: Medium Range Support</p>

<p>Personality: Mina is a cheerful, easygoing girl who displays a wide smile on her face most of the time. Highly social and excitable, she loves to hang out with her friends, and is shown to become very upset when denied an opportunity to be at a gathering. She possesses strong fashion sense and likes to go shopping. Due to her athleticism and energy, Mina enjoys and is very skilled at dancing. Her demeanor becomes more strict and perfectionistic when teaching others how to dance, in a direct contrast to her usual happy-go-lucky nature. She is known to use her dancing to somehow pacify even those who have bad relationships with others. Mina's academic performance is notably poor, with Mina goofily laughing about it despite showing clear anxiety and frustration on the inside. Because of that, she is sometimes viewed as an airhead by her classmates (second only to Denki Kaminari.) Still, Mina is capable of showing dedication to her studies as long as she gets proper Mina is somewhat of a romantic and holds a lot of interest over the love lives of other people, to the point of being obnoxiously curious and intrusive about them. Her suspicions, however, tend to be rather baseless most of the time, as she seems to view any instance of a pairing as possible proof of a relationship regardless of compatibility.</p>

<p>Fighting Style: Long Range Combat</p>

<p>Personality: Yuga appears to be a vain and prideful person, thinking of himself as superior to the rest of his classmates, especially in regards to his Quirk. He exhibits extremely flamboyant mannerisms, is fond of posing and likes to grab the attention of those around him despite frequently getting ignored by his peers. His expression rarely changes from a closed smile, even while he speaks or gets hurt, and he's also prone to getting upset if interrupted or questioned. Yuga's sentences often end with a star ☆ symbol, indicating a fancy tone. He also tends to play up his French heritage, occasionally implementing French words into his sentences. However, this persona is shown to be mostly a facade, as Yuga holds severe insecurities about his Quirk, and, in reality, he doesn't see himself as above anyone else. In fact, he appears to think of himself as different from everybody, due to the "defective" Quirk he was born with. Yuga has been struggling with this since his childhood and wishes to become "normal" one day. He is also easily frightened by danger and prefers to hide rather than fight, though he can still help out a friend as long as he remains safe and isn't above sacrificing himself, highly contrasting his usual self-centered attitude</p>

<p>Reference: The Big Three</p>

<p>Fighting Style: Melee and Support Combat</p>

<p>Personality: Tamaki is extremely shy, aloof, depressed, "intimidating" and introverted, especially around audiences. He gets nervous very easily when talking to other people. If his anxiety gets the best of him, Tamaki will often face away and lean into a wall to hide his face from others. This also happens whenever Tamaki has a bad feeling or feels insulted. While his physical abilities and Quirk are outstanding, Tamaki is very socially awkward and lacks confidence in his own powers. He apparently feels overwhelmed by the pressure to be perfect and this has damaged his self-esteem. Tamaki is quick to point out when others are being too optimistic in his pessimistic opinion and is unable to recognize his own achievements.Despite his timid heart, Tamaki is fully capable of showing flashes of bravery. Even though he's always been a shy and reserved boy, Tamaki was able to hone his skills and climb the ranks into one of U.A.'s  Big 3 Mirio Togata is a big inspiration for Tamaki, and their cooperation throughout their lives has lead Tamaki to establish his own set of stern beliefs which he will uphold and vocalize. Tamaki does not believe anyone should undermine another person's hard work. He noticed  Class 1-A could not recognize how much work Mirio put into honing his own power, and even showed his face to comment on it.</p>

<p>Height: 5'4½"</p>

<p>Blood Type: N/A</p>

<p>Reference: The Big Three</p>

<p>Fighting Style: Ranged Combat</p>

<p>Personality: Nejire is naturally a very kind, talkative and endlessly curious girl. She shows great interest in people's unique physical features and is easily distracted by them. Due to this, Nejire can be very blunt, often asking rather invasive or off-putting questions. Nejire is an affectionate person and a "free spirit," someone who has a genuine passion for learning new and strange things and isn't afraid to speak her mind or show how she feels. She seems to like knowing more than others, but not in a proud way, as she just enjoys explaining things to people and sharing her knowledge. She is mentioned to act like a kindergartner due to her childish glee. She is very enthusiastic, affable and cheery, and is always seen moving. She does not seem very concerned for Tamaki Amajiki when she learns of his attack, possibly due to having a more optimistic view than everyone else. Thanks to her inquisitive and chatty demeanor, she is a notably level-headed individual, though she comes off as an "airhead" most of the time. Despite her happy-go-lucky personality, Nejire is fierce in battle. When the situation calls for it, Nejire can be very calm and focused. Her curiosity never seems to extend to the enemy and she always maintains her focus on taking them down. Her strong heart is what has allowed her to climb the ranks into one of U.A.'s top three students.</p>

<p>Height: 5'11¼"</p>

<p>Blood Type: B</p>

<p>Reference: The Big Three</p>

<p>Fighting Style: Melee Combat</p>

<p>Personality:  Mirio normally comes across as extremely goofy and very energetic with some peculiar habits. Going solely based on his personality, many tend to question how Mirio is  U.A.'s top student. Mirio has a very optimistic attitude and is also almost always smiling. His personality is what led  <a href="https://bokunoheroacademia.fandom.com/wiki/Mirai_Sasaki "Mirai Sasaki">Sir Nighteye</a> to believe that he could be the man to replace  All Might as the symbol of peace. Mirio does not allow his laid back nature to cloud his judgment or impede his dreams of becoming a hero. He has proven to be an extremely hard worker, turning a near-unmasterable ability into one of the world's most powerful Quirks. Mirio is constantly looking for ways to improve his skills and tries to work toward his goals by accumulating different experiences to learn from them. Like many young men and women, Mirio was inspired by All Might to become a hero. Knowing he can't rescue everyone, Mirio chose the hero name "Lemillion" because he aspires to be a hero who can save over one million people. Despite Mirio's uplifting personality, he can suffer from failure just like everyone else. He has an excellent understanding of hero protocols and controlling his emotions in order to see the bigger picture. Alongside his bravery, Mirio has shown to be confident in his abilities. He knew he could take on all of Class 1-A to teach them a lesson and was even bold enough to face four of the <a href="https://bokunoheroacademia.fandom.com/wiki/Shie_Hassaikai "Shie Hassaikai">Shie Hassaikai</a> alone. Mirio clearly believes in his strength and always shouts "<strong>POWERR!</strong>" after winning a fight.</p>

<p>Blood Type: AB</p>

<p>Reference: General Department from Class 1-C</p>

<p>Fighting Style: Support Combat</p>

<p>Personality: Hitoshi is a very stoic and straightforward person with an innate ability to spark conversation with anyone, despite holding a reserved and quiet attitude most of the time. He is shown to be rather clever, being able to manipulate others into replying to his words, allowing him the opportunity to activate his Quirk. Due to having his  Brainwashing  Quirk perceived as evil, throughout his whole life Hitoshi has been somewhat feared by those who are aware of his power and has been discriminated against solely because of the Quirk he was born with. This led him to become resentful of those who had Quirks more associated with Hero work, using  Izuku Midoriya as an example by stating that someone as blessed as him would never understand what it's like to have an ability like his own. Regardless of his drawbacks, however, Hitoshi desires to become a  Pro Hero more than anything, with a deep longing to disprove those that doubt his heroic intentions. Not only does he want to refute those who shame his abilities, but he also aspires to usurp students who walk the path towards becoming a Pro Hero, as he wished to. While he stated he had no interest in making friends, Hitoshi has been surrounded by many students who see him as a friend.</p>

<p>Reference: Department of Support from Class 1-H</p>

<p>Fighting Style: N/A</p>

<p>Personality: Mei is a smart, off-setting, and assertive girl, often making those around her uncomfortable. She loves creating gadgets, which she refers to as her "super cute babies". Mei has a habit of "going straight to the point and is very shameless and opportunistic when it comes to advertising her inventions. While talking to people, she has a habit of getting awkwardly close to them, which usually causes them to back away from her but she still moves up to them. Mei shows no fear when it comes to failing, seeing it as an opportunity to learn and do better next time, which is why she does not mind when her inventions fail. Mei can be seen as self-centered due to putting her love of inventions and gadgets above others, but this selfishness is not a negative as it is out of motivation to improve herself. She does seem to be a little bit absent-minded as she is easily distracted and can sometimes be completely unaware of her surroundings, as shown by her inability to sense one of her inventions catch on fire as she was speaking with Midoriya. Furthermore, she seems inept at reading body language and social cues, apparently being oblivious to Midoriya's discomfort with her proximity to him on several occasions.</p>

<p>Blood Type: N/A</p>

<p>Reference: U.A. Teachers Committee</p>

<p>Fighting Style: Melee Combat</p>

<p>Personality: All Might's hero persona appears to be derived from comic book superhero stereotypes: colorful and filled with dramatic flair. Always sporting a giant smile, All Might shows a bright, borderline obnoxious, can-do attitude that is said to inspire others as well as help them feel safe and hopeful. He is extremely friendly and amicable due to his popularity and years in the spotlight, always taking his time to interact with fans. All Might rose to become not only a hero, but a legend, no thanks to his seemingly endless competency and charisma. No matter who or what he faced, All Might would stand up triumphantly in the end every time, inspiring the world and sending fear to the hearts of villains everywhere. Unfortunately for All Might, injuries inflicted on his body were starting to take a toll on him. Despite the concern and warnings from some of his close associates, All Might's determination to preserve society from evil prevented him from relinquishing his role as the Symbol of Peace. His smile, once a gesture that served to calm others, started becoming more of a way for All Might to hide his fears and insecurities from the general population. As time passed, All Might began to forget some of the basic principles of heroism, until Izuku Midoriya, in a brave attempt to save a classmate from a villain, rekindled his heroic spirit and taught him that something can always be done to fight injustice.</p>

<p>Fighting Style: N/A</p>

<p>Personality: Shota is a very stern and mostly reserved man who has lofty expectations of his students. He is primarily moved by logic and does not believe in the necessity to maintain a clean-cut appearance or filter his words or ideas for others. He often comes off as cold, apathetic, and impatient, exhorting very little energy in most situations, preferring to take naps in his sleeping bag instead. As a teacher of high expectations, Shota is known to expel students who he feels are not suited for U.A. High, although it is noteworthy that he has not expelled any students from Class 1-A yet despite being well-known for doing so. He can be rigid and strict when necessary, and also has little tolerance for disobedient behavior. Shota is not afraid of putting his students through rigorous training and often pushes the more unpleasant parts of Heroism so that his students can overcome their limits. Shota has proven to be very vocal and unafraid when expressing his ideas. Despite his apathetic traits, Shota genuinely cares about his students and will go to great lengths to protect them. Shota has shown on several occasions that he is not completely devoid of joy or humor. Despite his personality, he often grins whenever he is impressed by one of his students or after they fall for his deceptive tricks.</p>

<p>Fighting Style: N/A</p>

<p>Personality: Hizashi maintains the eccentric persona of a radio host. He often poses when he talks and maintains a certain level of excitement or volume regardless of the situation. His attitude made Kyoka Jiro mistake him for a simple announcer rather than an actual Pro Hero. When in front of a crowd of people, he often attempts to bring his audience up to his level by getting them involved (he sometimes refers to them as his 'listeners', even while on a live stage). He will continue to act this way regardless of the crowds' response. He also has a good people sense, knowing to restrain  Shota Aizawa from a crowd of reporters, a situation that could have resulted in widespread negative publicity. Present Mic has a great aversion to bugs, to the point where he faints when too many are in his general vicinity. He admits to much preferring urban areas to forested ones.</p>

<p>Blood Type: B</p>

<p>Reference:  U.A. Teachers Committee</p>

<p>Fighting Style: Close Combat</p>

Personality: Initially, Gran Torino appeared to be a senile old man who constantly forgot and asked  Izuku Midoriya's name, often calling him "Toshinori".Even though he was the one who sent Izuku the internship offer, he would often fail to recall Izuku's name for more than a moment. In reality, this proves to be nothing more than a facade for messing with his newfound protege. Gran Torino is actually a very intelligent man with an incredibly broad perception. He proved to be a far more capable teacher to Izuku in a mere week than All Might did in almost a year. He was able to read Izuku's progress and personality, just by watching him at the  U.A. Sports Festival and indirectly taught him the first step to mastering  One For All with a simple parallel between Izuku and his favorite dessert(Taiyaki). As a mentor, Gran Torino appears to be very hard on his students. Every time All Might speaks about or to Gran Torino, he starts freaking out and shakes profusely because of his memories of their brutal training. Gran Torino also never hesitates to yell, berate, and hit Izuku for his mistakes.

<p>Blood Type: A</p>

<p>Reference: U.A. Teachers Committee</p>

<p>Fighting Style: Medium Range Combat</p>

<p>Personality: Midnight is a very playful and flirtatious person with a unpredictably serious and temperamental side to her. She gets angry whenever someone interrupts her or when they insult her, and, when it comes to insults, she is especially sensitive about her age. Midnight has no shame for dressing or acting sexually in front of young students and appears to act on whims most of the time. When she accepted <a href="https://bokunoheroacademia.fandom.com/wiki/Mashirao_Ojiro "Mashirao Ojiro">Mashirao Ojiro</a>  and  <a href="https://bokunoheroacademia.fandom.com/wiki/Nirengeki_Shoda "Nirengeki Shoda">Nirengeki Shoda</a>’s request to resign from the tournament, she commented that their naivety "turned her on". She was also very excited to see the chivalry displayed by  Eijiro Kirishimaduring the tournament when he shook  <a href="https://bokunoheroacademia.fandom.com/wiki/Tetsutetsu_Tetsutetsu "Tetsutetsu Tetsutetsu">Tetsutetsu Tetsutetsu</a>’s hand.   When Class 1-A needed to decide on code names for their internship, Midnight displayed her willingness to help her students by making sure they chose names that would represent themselves well. Despite her flirtatious personality, Midnight is intelligent, perceptive, and articulate, as seen when she logically explained the reasoning behind some hero's having revealing costumes to make full use of their quirks, and how that lead to "sexy" costumes and how she single handedly instituted the costume regulations. <a href="https://bokunoheroacademia.fandom.com/wiki/Yu_Takeyama "Yu Takeyama">Mt. Lady</a>  replied that it's because she likes dressing way she does. Her love of "youth" is also a reason she gets angry when someone mentions her age or calls her old.</p>

<p>Personality: Chiyo has a very kind and compassionate personality, where she treats everyone kindly, though she does have a strict and reproaching attitude towards those that have done something foolish. She's mostly like this with All Might for not teaching Izuku how to use his Quirk properly or with Izuku for using his Quirk recklessly.</p>

<p>Blood Type: A</p>

<p>Reference: U.A. High School's Principal</p>

<p>Fighting Style: N/A</p>

<p>Personality: As befitting to his role as Principal of an academy for heroes, Nezu is an eccentric, polite, and persistent educator. He is quite self-aware of his odd appearance and introduces himself by pointing it out. He can be very long-winded at times when explaining or educating. Nezu composed an entire lecture on his educational theories concerning the balance between hero and instructor, which he happily spoke of over tea with  All Might. His dedication to educating goes as far as assessing villains, especially young ones, and wondering if they could be put on the right path if they were taught, although he admits the naivety of the idea. He is not above putting himself on the front lines, with his focus being the protection of the students. He understands strategies between hero conflicts enough to participate in the debriefing after the invasion. As a result of abuse and mistreatment by humans in the past, Nezu's true character reveals itself whenever he is in combat. He enjoys "toying" with humans. He still carries a grudge over the many experiments he went through, coming off as slightly insane and unpredictable as a result.</p>
