<p>Hero Name: Deku</p>

<p>Age: 16</p>

<p>Birthday: 07/15</p>

<p>Quirk: One for All </p>

<p>Height: 5'5¼"</p>

<p>Blood Type: O</p>

<p>Reference: Class 1-A</p>

<p>Fighting Style: Close-range Combat and Long-range Combat</p>

<p>Personality: Is a very timid, helpful, and polite boy, frequently overreacting to abnormal situations with exaggerated expressions. Due to being bullied for lacking a Quirk, he is initially portrayed as insecure, more reserved, and non-expressive. These traits are especially present around Katsuki, who constantly ridiculed him for his aspirations to be a hero. However, after being accepted into U.A. Highscool, making new friends, and facing Katsuki during the Battle Tri Arc, Midoriya gradually turned into a more confident and brave person, eventually developing leadership skills. Has a great analytical mind and can form complex battle plans in seconds.</p>

<p>Hero Name: King Explosion Murder</p>

<p>Age: 16</p>

<p>Birthday: 04/20</p>

<p>Quirk: Explosion </p>

<p>Height: 5'7¾"</p>

<p>Blood Type: A</p>

<p>Reference: Class 1-A</p>

<p>Fighting Style: Melee and Ranged Combat</p>

<p>Personality: Crude, arrogant, short-tempered, and an aggressive person. Tends to disregard the notion that Quirks shouldn't be used in public, and will activate his Quirk for a number of reasons, such as to intimidate someone, to punctuate a point, out of frustration, or even if he just feels like showing off. Developed a superiority complex, and because of that, he desires to be the first and best at everything.</p>



<h1>Todoroki Shoto</h1>

<p>Hero Name: Shoto</p>

<p>Age: 15</p>

<p>Birthday: 01/11</p>

<p>Quirk: Half-Cold Half-Hot</p> 

<p>Height: 5' 9¼"</p>

<p>Blood Type: O</p>

<p>Reference: Class 1-A</p>

<p>Fighting Style: Ranged Combat</p>

<p>Personality: Originally had a cold, aloof personality which stemmed from his abusive upbringing. Focused and unemotional, Shoto preferred to keep to himself instead of hanging out with other people. After the events of the U.A. Sports Festival, however, Shoto has become noticeably more sociable, even gaining a sense of humor and occasionally smiling, although still retaining the remnants of a distant attitude. After the events in the Remedial Course Arc, he has begun to open up more to his classmates and has lightened up from his usually serious demeanor. Is quite seasoned in battle, being able to stay calm and composed even while fighting real villains. Though brutal in combat, Shoto is well-grounded on the ethics of heroism, only wishing to subdue his frozen opponents as opposed to killing them by prolonging their frozen states.</p>
